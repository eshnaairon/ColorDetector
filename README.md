# Color Detector
Color detection using opencv python

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps.

This is an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by double clicking on it.
I have used a data file that contains the color name and its values (colors.csv). Then I calculated the distance from each color and the color with the shortest distance is selected. 

Technology and tools wise this project covers-
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. OpenCV
5. Argparse library (to get the image from the user)

### To Run 
Write the following code in cmd-

_python color_detection.py -i (path of the image you want to use)_


Here is an example-
